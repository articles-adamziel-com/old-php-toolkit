## PHP Toolkit

Standalone PHP libraries for use in WordPress plugins and standalone PHP projects:

-   XMLProcessor – stream-parse XML files on any PHP installation (no libxml2 required).
-   Git – a pure PHP implementation of Git client and server.
-   HttpClient – a streaming, non-blocking, concurrent HTTP client library with no curl dependency.
-   Zip – stream-parse and stream-write ZIP files with no libzip dependency.
-   Data Liberation – generic streaming data importers to WordPress. Supports WXR, zipped markdown, remote git repos, rewriting URLs, and more.
-   ByteStream – composable byte streaming utilities – readers, writers, filters.
-   Markdown – convert between markdown and block markup with no dependencies.
-   Filesystem – single API for working with local files, Git, Google drive, memory, etc.

This fork consolidates a few earlier projects and explorations into a single composer package.

### Using the libraries

#### In WordPress

The included [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/php-toolkit) ships the libraries from this repository. Include it as a dependency in your plugin to use the PHP libraries safely.

Why not just ship the libraries with your plugin? Imagine two plugins doing that. They would conflict, trigger a PHP fatal error on every page load, and break the site.

#### Outside of WordPress

Use composer to install the libraries in a non-WordPress project.

This is the minimal composer.json file you need to consume the libraries:

```json
{
	"name": "my-namespace/my-package",
	"require": {
		"Automattic/php-toolkit": "dev-trunk"
	},
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "github",
			"url": "https://github.com/Automattic/php-toolkit"
		}
	]
}
```

You can also lock it in to a specific commit or tag:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"Automattic/php-toolkit": "dev-trunk#122b547"
	}
}
```

For now, there is no way to cherry-pick just the one library you need. It's all or nothing.

Note that the composer.json example above downloads more files than the required minimum, e.g. markdowns, unit tests, the `plugins` directory, etc. That's about 50MB of code in total and, most likely, it's not a big deal for your project. If you want a smaller package, the Data Liberation plugin referenced above ships a minified phar file that's about ~500KB compressed.

If you'd like to install just a single library, you'll need to contribute a PR to distribute each library as a separate package. Most likely, though, you don't really need that. If you have doubts, open a new issue and we'll figure it out together.

### Design goals

-   Build re-entrant data tools that can start, stop, resume, tolerate errors, accept alternative media files, posts etc. from the user.
-   WordPress-first – Everything is built in PHP using WordPress coding standards. The divergences are strategic and minimal, such as the use of namespaces.
-   Compatibility – Support for major WordPress versions, PHP version (7.2+), and Playground runtime (web, CLI, browser extension, desktop app, CI etc.).
-   Dependency-free – No PHP extensions are required and only minimal Composer dependencies are allowed when absolutely necessary.
-   Simple – The architectural role model is [WP_HTML_Processor](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_html_processor/) – a **single class** that can parse nearly all HTML. There's no "Node", "Element", "Attribute" classes etc. Let's aim for the same here. Some OOP patterns are used when useful, but we're explicitly avoiding ideas like AbstractSingletonFactoryProxy.
-   Extensibility – Playground should be able to benefit from, say, WASM markdown parser even if core WordPress cannot.
-   Reusability – Each library should be framework-agnostic and usable outside of WordPress.

### Development

#### Testing

To run the PHPUnit test suite, run:

```sh
composer test
```

#### Linting

To run the PHP_CodeSniffer linting suite, run:

```sh
composer lint
```

To fix the linting errors, run:

```sh
composer lint-fix
```

#### Composer

The root composer.json file is an amalgamation of composer.base.json all
component composer.json files. To regenerate it, run:

```sh
bin/regenerate_composer.json.php
```

This will merge all the package-specific dependencies and the autoload rules into
the root composer.json file.
