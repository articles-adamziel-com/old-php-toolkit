## WordPress components and Data Liberation

Standalone libraries meant for eventual inclusion in WordPress core.

This repository is what you, as a WordPress developer, have been dreaming
of. Really. Here's why:

* XMLProcessor – stream-parse XML files on any PHP installation (no libxml2 required).
* Git – a pure PHP implementation of Git client and server.
* HttpClient – a streaming, non-blocking, concurrent HTTP client library with no curl dependency.
* Zip – stream-parse and stream-write ZIP files with no libzip dependency.
* Data Liberation – generic streaming data importers to WordPress. Supports WXR, zipped markdown, remote git repos, rewriting URLs, and more.
* ByteStream – composable byte streaming utilities – readers, writers, filters.
* Markdown – convert between markdown and block markup with no dependencies.
* Filesystem – single API for working with local files, Git, Google drive, memory, etc.

This project aims to modernize WordPress's data handling capabilities and power
the Data Liberation project. See [the rationale](RATIONALE.md) and [the plan](PLAN.md)
for more details.

### Play with it

Here's a very rough process you can use to start WordPress with a plugin that
uses most of the components shipped with this project.

1. Create a file plugins/static-files-editor/secrets.php with the following content:

```php
<?php
define('GIT_REPO_URL', 'https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce.git');
define('GIT_BRANCH', 'trunk');
define('GIT_DIRECTORY_ROOT', '/docs');

define('GIT_USER_NAME', 'Your name');
define('GIT_USER_EMAIL', 'your@email.com');
```

2. Run the following command to start WordPress with the plugin:

```sh
bash run.sh
```

3. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:9400/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=local_file&dump=1 to import the WooCommerce documentation.
4. You're done!

The UI build process is not configured yet so this won't get the static files editor UI right now. This part is TBD.

### Development

#### Testing

To run the PHPUnit test suite, run:

```sh
composer test
```

#### Linting

To run the PHP_CodeSniffer linting suite, run:

```sh
composer lint
```

To fix the linting errors, run:

```sh
composer lint-fix
```

#### Composer

The root composer.json file is an amalgamation of composer.base.json all 
component composer.json files. To regenerate it, run:

```sh
bin/regenerate_composer.json.php
```

This will merge all the package-specific dependencies and the autoload rules into
the root composer.json file.
