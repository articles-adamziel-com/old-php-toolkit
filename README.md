## PHP Toolkit

Standalone PHP libraries for use in WordPress plugins and standalone PHP projects:

-   XMLProcessor – stream-parse XML files on any PHP installation (no libxml2 required).
-   Git – a pure PHP implementation of Git client and server.
-   HttpClient – a streaming, non-blocking, concurrent HTTP client library with no curl dependency.
-   Zip – stream-parse and stream-write ZIP files with no libzip dependency.
-   Data Liberation – generic streaming data importers to WordPress. Supports WXR, zipped markdown, remote git repos, rewriting URLs, and more.
-   ByteStream – composable byte streaming utilities – readers, writers, filters.
-   Markdown – convert between markdown and block markup with no dependencies.
-   Filesystem – single API for working with local files, Git, Google drive, memory, etc.

This fork consolidates a few earlier projects and explorations into a single composer package.

### Using the Blueprints v2 runner

The Blueprints v2 runner is an all-php CLI tool that runs Blueprints v1 and v2. To use it, download [blueprints.phar from the latest release](https://github.com/Automattic/php-toolkit/releases) and run it:

```sh
php blueprints.phar
```

From there, follow the help message for required arguments and options.

If you want to use Blueprints as a library, you absolutely can. It is designed to be reusable,
compatible with web and CLI environments on PHP 7.2+. There's not much technical documentation
at this point but you can refer to the [blueprints.php file](https://github.com/Automattic/php-toolkit/blob/219dc4e846af270a5009e523244d0ec23baaa32a/components/Blueprints/bin/blueprint.php#L226) to see
how the runner is implemented.

### Using the libraries

Use composer to install the libraries in a non-WordPress project.

This is the minimal composer.json file you need to consume the libraries:

```json
{
	"name": "my-namespace/my-package",
	"require": {
		"Automattic/php-toolkit": "^v0.0.21-alpha"
	},
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "github",
			"url": "https://github.com/Automattic/php-toolkit"
		}
	]
}
```

You can also lock it in to a specific commit or tag:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"Automattic/php-toolkit": "dev-trunk#122b547"
	}
}
```

For now, there is no way to cherry-pick just the one library you need. It's all or nothing.

Note that the composer.json example above downloads more files than the required minimum, e.g. markdowns, unit tests, the `plugins` directory, etc. That's about 50MB of code in total and, most likely, it's not a big deal for your project. If you want a smaller package, the Data Liberation plugin referenced above ships a minified phar file that's about ~500KB compressed.

If you'd like to install just a single library, you'll need to contribute a PR to distribute each library as a separate package. Most likely, though, you don't really need that. If you have doubts, open a new issue and we'll figure it out together.

### Design goals

-   Build re-entrant data tools that can start, stop, resume, tolerate errors, accept alternative media files, posts etc. from the user.
-   WordPress-first – Everything is built in PHP using WordPress coding standards. The divergences are strategic and minimal, such as the use of namespaces.
-   Compatibility – Support for major WordPress versions, PHP version (7.2+), and Playground runtime (web, CLI, browser extension, desktop app, CI etc.).
-   Dependency-free – No PHP extensions are required and only minimal Composer dependencies are allowed when absolutely necessary.
-   Simple – The architectural role model is [WP_HTML_Processor](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_html_processor/) – a **single class** that can parse nearly all HTML. There's no "Node", "Element", "Attribute" classes etc. Let's aim for the same here. Some OOP patterns are used when useful, but we're explicitly avoiding ideas like AbstractSingletonFactoryProxy.
-   Extensibility – Playground should be able to benefit from, say, WASM markdown parser even if core WordPress cannot.
-   Reusability – Each library should be framework-agnostic and usable outside of WordPress.

### Development

#### Testing

To run the PHPUnit test suite, run:

```sh
composer test
```

#### Linting

To run the PHP_CodeSniffer linting suite, run:

```sh
composer lint
```

To fix the linting errors, run:

```sh
composer lint-fix
```

#### Composer

The root composer.json file is an amalgamation of composer.base.json all
component composer.json files. To regenerate it, run:

```sh
bin/regenerate_composer.json.php
```

This will merge all the package-specific dependencies and the autoload rules into
the root composer.json file.

### Windows compatibility

Windows compatibility is achieved on a few different fronts:

#### Newlines

This repository comes with a `.gitattributes` file to ensure that the unit test
files and fixtures are normalized to `\n` on checkout. It's important, because
Windows uses `\r\n` for newlines in text files. Unix-based systems use `\n`.
Without the `.gitattributes`, git on Windows would replace all the `\n` with `\r\n` 
on checkout.

The strings produced by the library uses `\n` for newlines where it can make
that choice. For example, the `WXRWriter` class will separate XML tags with
`\n` newlines to make sure the generated XML is consistent across platforms.

#### Paths

The `Filesystem` components makes a point of using Unix-style forward slashes
as directory separators, even on Windows.

As a library consumer, ensure all the local paths you pass to the library are
using Unix-style forward slashes as directory separators. A simple str_replace
will do the trick:

```php
if (DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR === '\\') {
	$path = str_replace('\\', '/', $path);
}
```

The reason for using Unix-style forward slashes is care for data integrity.
Windows understands both forward slashes and backslashes, so the replacement
operation is safe there. On Unix, however, a backslash can be used as a part
of a filename so it cannot be safely translated.

Importantly, do not just run this str_replace() on every possible path.
`C:\my-dir\my-file.txt` is both, a valid Windows absolute path and a valid Unix
filename and a relative path. Furthermore, `Filesystem` supports more filesystems
than just local disk.

Anytime you're handling paths, consider:

-   Which filesystem is this path related to? Local? Remote? Git?
-   Which OS are you on? Windows? Unix?

If the answers are "local" and "Windows", you may need to apply the `str_replace()`
slash normalization. Otherwise, just keep the path as it is.

The takeaway from this section is: **paths are difficult**.
